## 📢 Reddit Strategy (r/webdev, r/reactjs, r/frontend)

**Title:**
> I was tired of boring portfolios, so I built a "Glassmorphism" template with React & Vite (Open Source)

**Body:**
> Hey everyone,
>
> I've been refining my personal portfolio recently and fell in love with the "Frosted Glass" aesthetic (Glassmorphism). I wanted something that felt alive but didn't require heavy 3D libraries.
>
> I built this template using **React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion**.
>
> **The cool parts:**
> *   Pure CSS "Aurora" background blobs (no WebGL).
> *   fully configured `CONFIG` object so you can edit the whole site without touching JSX.
> *   Smooth entrance animations.
>
> It's fully open source and MIT licensed. I wrote a small guide in the README on how the glass effect works if you're curious about the CSS.
>
> **Repo:** [Link to your GitHub]
> **Demo:** [Link to your Demo]
>
> Let me know what you think!
